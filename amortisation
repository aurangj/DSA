Amortisation is basically the calculation of average cost of the operations.
There are certain operations for the data structure such as arrays when they reach the upper limit. The size needs to  be
doubled and elements be moved around. but the cost of  subsequent access remains constant.
So, if we consider the cost of doubling of array plus cost of subsequent access. the average cost is basically constant
as 2x increase in size is not a frequent operation.
